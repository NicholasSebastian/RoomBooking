# Room Booking

This program is made for my UOW CSIT214 IT Project Management Group Project.

The group is contracted by the CIO of UOW to develop a room booking system for UOW staff and students.
As a minimum requirement, the system should provide the following functions:

- Room creation and management: only done by a staff user, he/she shall be able to
    1. create a room,
    2. launch a room (make available for reservations of a newly created room),
    3. adjust the price (each booking is chargeable), date/time, promotional codes, and capacity of room.
- Room booking: only done by a student user, he/she can
    1. view the list of rooms available,
    2. make a booking of one or more rooms,
    3. modify an existing booking and
    4. cancel an existing booking.

Please note that only a UOW staff can perform a staff’s role, and only a UOW student can perform a student’s role. Both roles are mutually exclusive (i.e. a staff cannot perform a student’s role and a student cannot perform a staff’s role)
